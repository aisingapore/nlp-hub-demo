          Next, create a folder under the `sgnlp/models/` folder and split your
          codebase into the following files:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            `config.py` - script containing a HuggingFace's `PretrainedConfig`
            class.
          </li>
          <li>
            `modeling.py` - script containing a HuggingFace's `PretrainedModel`
            class.
          </li>
          <li>
            `preprocess.py` - script containing a data preprocessing pipeline
            which converts raw text into input tensors for the model.
          </li>
          <li>`train.py` - script containing code to train the model.</li>
          <li>`eval.py` - script containing code to evaluate the model.</li>
          <li>
            `postprocess.py` - optional script containing code to post-process
            the model output.
          </li>
          <li>
            `tokenization.py` - optional script containing a HuggingFace's
            `PretrainedTokenizer` class.

        Next, start training your model and/or tokenizer with the refactored

        `save_pretrained` method.

    header: "Unit testing",
    text: (
      <>
        A good project codebase should always be covered by unit tests. At a
        minimum, we recommend contributors include unit tests for all their
        classes and functions including tests to ensure the train loop is
        working properly. Simply create a folder for your project under the
        `tests` folder and store all your unit test files there.

  {
    header: "Documentation",
    text: (
      <>
        <p>
          Another property of a good project is documentation. At a minimum, we
          recommend contributors include a README.md file in their project
          folder to provide information with regards to the model as well as for
          instructions on how to train, evaluate and run inferences with the
          model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optionally, we also recommend contributors provide advanced
          documentation in the form of Sphinx Document format for their project
          in the `sgnlp/docs/model/` folder. Simply create a .rst file and start
          documenting away!

        API backend to run batch inferences against their pretrained models. To
        contribute, create a project folder under the `demo_api` folder and add
        at a minimum, an `api.py` script which contains the Flask API
        implementation, a `requirements.txt` file, a `usage.py` script showing
        the code to load the pretrained weights and perform a batch inference
        and a `model_card` folder with a JSON file containing information about
        the model.

        Finally, submit a pull request of your project code to the SGnlp
        repository `dev` branch. (Do include a link to the pretrained weights
        and/or tokenizer files from step 4 in your pull request) Engineers
        supporting the SGnlp project will perform a code review and provide
        feedback (if any). Once the project code is reviewed with all feedback
        concluded, it will be merged to the `dev` branch and released publicly
        in the next major release!
